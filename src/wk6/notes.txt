Exception:
    when the script does not finish executing

a script should finish executing

Does that mean that an exception is an error?
    Yes: RunTime error. Neither syntax nor logical error

How does an exception occur
    1) inifite loop: StackOverflow
    2) When attempting to
            a) convert method
            b) open a file/resource
            c) user input

How to avoid exception
    try-catch statements

    try, catch?

    try/attempt to conver, open, get user input
    catch: an error that may occur

Brace scope: any variable declared inside of braces is only accessible inside of the brace


Stack:
    a data structure
        items/values are stacked on top of eachother
            think a pile of dishes
    in a stack, methods are called in order that they are called.
    but executed in reverse order

            C
            B
            A

method call: when the is declared and put on the stack (when person put dish in sink)
method execution: when dish is washed
