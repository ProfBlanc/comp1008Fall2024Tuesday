Polymorphism
    Poly = many, multiple
    morphism = bodies, forms

Are the two O's examples of polymorphism?
    Override: change implemention
    Overloading: add variation


Classes have be made up of multiple
    components
        internal (hdd, video cards, etc)
            abstract classes
        external (screens, keyboards, etc)
            interfaces
    concrete class: class that is self-sufficient
                    functions by itself

    abstract classes
        dedicated superclass.
        incomplete: needs a subclass to extend it
            -an incomplete method
                abstract method
        it has all the features of concrete class
            instance variables, methods, constructors, constants
            -incomplete method (abstract method)
        Abstract classes good use to categorize an entity

        Shape: of form of something
                could have sides
                could have radius
                could be 2 or 3d

                area, perimeter: good abstract method candidates

    interface
        list of requirements
            outline ACTIONS that need to be implemented
            only have declarations and final values (NOT instance variables)
            all entities (final, constant values and methods) are public
        class can implement multiple interfaces




Game part 1:

Me: state an object
You: state if object should be concrete class, abstract class or interface

1) Does object function by itself
    Y: concret
    N: move to question 2
2) Since object doesn't exist by itself, it is a component of another object
    Is component an Internal or External component
    if internal: abstract
    if external: interface


Bag                             C
House                           C
Home                            C   A
Apartment 101 in Building       A
Floor                           I
Door                            I



Game part 2:

regular method          CA
abstract method         IA
constructor             CA
instance variable       CA
constant value          CAI
